# Last Campaign

Saves the last campaign (utm) query string parameters found on the current URL into a session cookie; so that they can be passed to your marketing automation system at any time during the users session.

By default, only `utm_campaign`, `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_content`, and `utm_term` are saved. Extra parameters can also be saved by passing them in via the `options.params` object. If the query string contains any of the parameters to be saved, a new session is assumed and previously set cookies will be removed.

`lastCampaign()` should be called on each page view.

Note: This is currently a browser only module because it reads the query string from `window.location.search` and sets cookies via the `document.cookie`. It could however, easily be modified to run as an express middleware and work on the server side.

Version 2 of last-campaign by default now sets cookies with a default session timeout of 30 minutes rather than a session cookie.

## Installation & Usage

### NPM
`$ npm install last-campaign`

```
var lastCampaign = require('last-campaign');
lastCampaign();
```

### Bower
`$ bower install last-campaign`

```
lastCampaign();
```

## Options

### `timeout` (Number)

Default session timeout in minutes. This should match the session timeout used in Google Analyutcs. Default `30`

Passing in `null` will disable the session timeout and revert to using a session cookie. E.g. `timeout: null`

### `prefix` (String)

Cookie name prefix. Default `''`

### `params` (Array)

An array of additional query string parameters to save. E.g. `['gclid']`.

### `data` (Object)

An object of additional values to save. Values are only saved once per session.

### `defaults` (Boolean)

Specify if the default parameters, `utm_campaign`, `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_content`, and `utm_term` should be saved. Default `true`

### `domain` (String)

Specify a domain to set cookie on. If you want this to work across all of your sub-domains, set this to your domain name prefixed with a period. E.g. `.yesware.com`

Default `null`

### `path` (String)

Cookie path.

Default `/`

## Examples

### Save `gclid` AdWords ID in addition to default parameters
```
lastCampaign({
    params: ['gclid']
});
```

### Save only the `foo` parameter with an `_` prefix
```
lastCampaign({
    prefix: '_',
    defaults: false,
    params: ['foo']
});
```

### Save `foo` value in addition to default parameters
```
lastCampaign({
    data: {
        foo: 'bar'
    }
});
```
